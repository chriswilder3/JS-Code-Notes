# JS-Code-Notes
An ample ampunt of code I wrote while learning Javascript. Can be used as notes also. 

## Usage
- Run the code in editor/IDE or in a browser directly
- The notes are written wherever necessary
- The results are mostly shown in console itself except some which are shown in HTML directly.
