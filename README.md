# JS-Code-Notes
An ample amount of code I wrote while learning Javascript. Can be used as notes also. 

## Usage
- Run the code in editor/IDE or in a browser directly
- The notes are written wherever necessary
- The results will be mostly shown in console itself except in some cases where innerHTML is used directly.
